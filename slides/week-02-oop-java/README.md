# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## Overview
This week covers fundamental OOP concepts in Java including inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and the Java Collections Framework. Students will build on their Week 1 Spring Boot API by adding service layers and repository patterns.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Implement inheritance hierarchies in Java
- Use polymorphism to write flexible code
- Design and implement interfaces
- Work with Java Collections (List, Set, Map)
- Build Spring Boot service layers
- Apply OOP principles to real projects

## Session Breakdown

### Session 3: Inheritance & Polymorphism (Tuesday)
- Extending classes with `extends`
- Method overriding vs overloading
- Abstract classes and methods
- Polymorphic behavior
- Spring service inheritance patterns

### Session 4: Interfaces & Collections (Thursday)
- Interface contracts and implementation
- Multiple inheritance through interfaces
- Java Collections Framework
- Generics basics
- Repository pattern in Spring

## Assignments

### Team Assignment 2 (Due Sept 18)
- Implement service layer with inheritance
- Create repository interfaces
- Use appropriate collections
- Achieve 80% test coverage

### Repository Analysis 1 (Individual, Due Sept 18)
- Analyze OOP patterns in a Spring Framework project
- 2-page analysis of inheritance, interfaces, and collections usage

## Key Concepts Covered
- Inheritance (`extends`)
- Method overriding (`@Override`)
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces and contracts
- Polymorphism
- Collections (List, Set, Map)
- Generics
- Spring dependency injection
- Repository pattern
