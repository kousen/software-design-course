<h2>CPSC 310: Software Design</h2>

<p><strong>Building Well-Designed Software Systems</strong> - A comprehensive introduction to software design principles, patterns, and practices in the era of AI-assisted development. You will learn to architect, implement, and test software systems that scale. Through hands-on team projects, you'll build production-ready Spring Boot applications while mastering SOLID principles, design patterns, and modern Java development. Upon completion, you'll understand how to create maintainable software architectures and critically evaluate both human and AI-generated code.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2025, 14 weeks in person</strong><br>
<strong>Class time:</strong> Tuesdays & Thursdays, 10:50 AM - 12:05 PM<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> CT-308<br>
<strong>Current Revision:</strong> September 1, 2025</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> C- or better in Computer Science 215</p>

<h2>Course Overview and Goals</h2>

<p>The majority of software failures stem from poor design, not poor coding. This course explores what makes software maintainable, testable, and scalable. We'll build real applications using Spring Boot while learning the principles that separate professional software from amateur code. You'll work in teams from day one, using AI tools as collaborators while developing the critical thinking to evaluate their output.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Master object-oriented and functional programming in Java</li>
<li>Apply SOLID principles to real systems</li>
<li>Implement design patterns appropriately</li>
<li>Build REST APIs with Spring Boot</li>
<li>Write comprehensive test suites</li>
<li>Perform effective code reviews</li>
<li>Collaborate using Git/GitHub workflows</li>
<li>Evaluate and improve AI-generated code</li>
<li>Deploy applications with CI/CD pipelines</li>
<li>Analyze existing codebases critically</li>
<li>Make architectural decisions</li>
<li>Work effectively in development teams</li>
</ul>
