## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to modern software design principles and practices. Students will learn to design, implement, and test software systems using Java with emphasis on object-oriented design, functional programming paradigms, and data-oriented approaches. The course emphasizes practical application of SOLID principles, design patterns, test-driven development, and software architecture in an era of AI-assisted development.

**Prerequisite:** C- or better in Computer Science 215

   - Evaluate trade-offs between different architectural approaches

2. **Modern Java Development**
   - Utilize Java 8+ features including lambdas, streams, and Optional
   - Implement functional programming patterns in Java
   - Apply data-oriented programming with records and pattern matching
   - Write concurrent and thread-safe code

3. **Testing and Quality**
   - Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) effectively
   - Write comprehensive unit tests using JUnit 5, AssertJ, and property-based testing
   - Evaluate and test AI-generated code for correctness and quality
   - Implement continuous integration pipelines

4. **Professional Development**
   - Collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub
   - Conduct meaningful code reviews
   - Work productively with AI development tools while maintaining critical thinking
