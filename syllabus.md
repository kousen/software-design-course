## CPSC 310: Software Design

**Building Well-Designed Software Systems** - A comprehensive introduction to software design principles, patterns, and practices in the era of AI-assisted development. You will learn to architect, implement, and test software systems that scale. Through hands-on team projects, you'll build production-ready Spring Boot applications while mastering SOLID principles, design patterns, and modern Java development. Upon completion, you'll understand how to create maintainable software architectures and critically evaluate both human and AI-generated code.

**Fall 2025, 14 weeks in person**  
**Class time:** Tuesdays & Thursdays, 10:50 AM - 12:05 PM  
**Location:** CT-308  
**Current Revision:** September 1, 2025

**Prerequisites:** C- or better in Computer Science 215

## Course Overview and Goals

The majority of software failures stem from poor design, not poor coding. This course explores what makes software maintainable, testable, and scalable. We'll build real applications using Spring Boot while learning the principles that separate professional software from amateur code. You'll work in teams from day one, using AI tools as collaborators while developing the critical thinking to evaluate their output.

### Goals
- Master object-oriented and functional programming in Java
- Apply SOLID principles to real systems
- Implement design patterns appropriately
- Build REST APIs with Spring Boot
- Write comprehensive test suites
- Perform effective code reviews
- Collaborate using Git/GitHub workflows
- Evaluate and improve AI-generated code
- Deploy applications with CI/CD pipelines
- Analyze existing codebases critically
- Make architectural decisions
- Work effectively in development teams

## Grading and Grade Weights

### Grade Components

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Attendance & Participation** | 10% | Active engagement in class and team activities |
| **Team Assignments** | 20% | Weekly team programming exercises |
| **Repository Analysis** | 30% | Individual analysis of existing codebases |
| **Team Project Milestones** | 40% | Four progressive project checkpoints |

### Detailed Grading Breakdown

#### Attendance and Participation (10%)
Regular attendance ensures course success. Your registration is a commitment to attending every class.

- More than two (2) unexcused absences result in zero attendance credit
- Continuous tardiness will receive a warning, then zero credit
- Notify instructor immediately for illness (Health Center note required)

#### Team Assignments (20%)
Weekly programming exercises completed in teams:
- Typically "implement features to make provided tests pass"
- Submitted via GitHub by one team member
- All team members must understand the code
- Lowest assignment grade dropped
- Due Thursdays at 11:59 PM unless otherwise specified

#### Repository Analysis Assignments (30%)
Individual assignments analyzing real GitHub projects:
- Identify design patterns and principles
- Evaluate code quality and architecture
- Propose improvements and refactorings
- Submitted individually via GitHub
- Graded on insight and understanding

#### Team Project Milestones (40%)
Progressive development of a Spring Boot application:

**Milestone 1 - Week 1 (10%)**
- Team formation and GitHub repository setup
- Basic Spring Boot application skeleton
- SonarCloud integration configured
- Initial API design document

**Milestone 2 - Week 7 (10%)**
- Complete CRUD API with proper layering
- SOLID principles applied throughout
- 80% test coverage achieved
- All code peer-reviewed via PRs

**Milestone 3 - Week 11 (10%)**
- Security implementation
- Design patterns applied (minimum 3)
- API documentation complete
- Performance benchmarks established

**Milestone 4 - Week 13 (10%)**
- Deployed to cloud platform
- CI/CD pipeline functional
- Final presentation prepared
- Complete project documentation

### Grading Scale
- A: 93-100
- A-: 90-92
- B+: 87-89
- B: 83-86
- B-: 80-82
- C+: 77-79
- C: 73-76
- C-: 70-72
- D+: 67-69
- D: 60-66
- F: Below 60

Grade weights are subject to small adjustments to ensure fair assignment of course grades.

## Expected Workload

Students should expect to engage in learning ~10-12 hours per week:
- Class time: 2.5 hours
- Pre-class preparation: 1-2 hours
- Team assignments & projects: 4-5 hours
- Code reviews & collaboration: 2-3 hours

---

## Team Structure

### Team Formation (Week 1)
- Teams of 3 students (one team may have 4)
- Mixed experience levels (Java/Python/Git)
- At least one member from CPSC 415 (Cloud Computing) where possible
- Teams remain together for entire semester
